We have made a simplistic Flask webapplication for our Webtechnology project. For our css we used a custom sass-built version of [Spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

## More info
This project mostly consists of Python and HTML templates for Flask, and some custom vanilla JS (mostly for frontend animations and our login modals).

Libraries we use in our Python code include but are not limited to:

- flask
- flask-wtf
- flask-login
- wtfforms
- SQLAlchemy
- flask-migrate
- werkzeug
